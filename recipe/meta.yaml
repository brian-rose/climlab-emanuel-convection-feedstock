  summary: 'Standalone Python wrapper for the Emanuel moist convection model'
  description: |
    climlab-emanuel-convection makes the Emanuel convection code callable
    from Python by wrapping using f2py. This is a lightweight wrapper that
    emulates the Fortran interface as closely as possible. The primary use case
    is to drive the convection process in climlab, but it can be used as
    a standalone driver if you are familiar with the Fortran interface.
